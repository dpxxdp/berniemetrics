                We are a group of volunteers excited to compile and visualize the numbers surrounding the Bernie Sanders run for the presidency.</p>
                <p>
                    We're trying to build, by hand and through scraping and api polling, a unique collection of statistics relating to Bernie Sanders' run and do two things with it:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>build a solid REST and Websocket API so programs can access "all numbers Bernie" cleanly and easily</li>
                    <li>visualize them powerfully in a  rich-media environment</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    We're also trying to do whatever you're good at because that's all we can do, so jump in on whatever you want!
                </p>
            </p>
            <p>
            If you have any experience with graphic design or web design we could especially use your help!
